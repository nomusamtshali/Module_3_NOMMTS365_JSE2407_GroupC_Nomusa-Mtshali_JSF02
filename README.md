[JSF02] Project: Svelte Challenge

## Project Overview

- As I embarked on the 'JSF02' project, I was tasked with the challenge of refactoring an existing React-based e-commerce store into a Svelte.js-based project. The starter code from the CodeSpace-Academy repo served as a foundation, and I had to utilize my newfound knowledge of Svelte.js to transform the application. The project involved fetching data from the Fake Store API to display in the store, which required a deep understanding of the API's endpoints and how to effectively integrate them with Svelte.js. Throughout this journey, I encountered numerous opportunities to learn and grow, and I'm thrilled to share my experiences and insights.

## Project Brief

1. Study and understand the Svelte e-commerce store rubric provided in your student sheet.

2. Have a look at the model e-commerce store provided in React: https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/jsf-react-ecommerce.

3. Study the Fake Store API and see what endpoints you will need to fetch different pieces of data from.

4. Code your solution in Svelte and document your code with JSDoc.

5. Commit changes to your Github repository (remember the naming convention: Module_3_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSF02)

6. Add a README.md file with the project description, how to set it up, technologies used and other information specified in the rubric

7. Test your application for any bugs and improvements.

8. Verify that your changes have been successfully pushed to your remote GitHub repository

9. Submit the GitHub Repository Link to the LMS JSF02 Submission Project Tab.

## Technologies Used

- Svelte.js: An open-source JavaScript framework designed to build user interfaces (UIs) for the web
- TailwindCSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the application.
- Fake Store API: A RESTful API used to fetch data for the e-commerce store.
- JavaScript: Used for writing the application's logic and interacting with the Fake Store API.

## Set Up Instructions

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone .
2. Open the project: Open the project folder in your preferred code editor or IDE.
3. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the project.
5. Follow the localhost link and open your web browser

## Usage examples

- Browse products: You can navigate to the application's homepage to browse available products.
- View product details: You can click on a product to view its details, including price, description, and reviews.
- Filter categories: You can filter through the different categories in the dropdown.
- Sort products: You can sort the product's prices from low to high, high to low or set it to default.

## Reflections

### Areas of Mastery

- Unfortunately, I did not achieve mastery in any specific areas during this project. Although I gained a solid understanding of Svelte.js and its ecosystem, I did not feel that I excelled in any particular aspect of the project. However, I did develop a foundation in the following areas:

- Svelte.js fundamentals: I gained a solid understanding of Svelte.js concepts, including components, state management, and event handling.
- API integration: I learned how to effectively integrate the Fake Store API with Svelte.js, including fetching data, handling errors, and parsing responses.
- Problem-solving: Throughout the project, I encountered numerous challenges that required me to think creatively and develop problem-solving skills.

### Challenges faced

- Learning Svelte.js: As a new framework, Svelte.js presented a steep learning curve. I had to invest time and effort to grasp its concepts, syntax, and best practices.
- Adapting pre-existing React code to work with Svelte.js: I faced challenges in converting the existing React code to work with Svelte.js, requiring me to think creatively and develop problem-solving skills.
- Diagnosing and troubleshooting issues with the Fake Store API: I encountered issues with the Fake Store API, such as data inconsistencies and endpoint limitations, which required me to troubleshoot and adapt my code to work around these issues.

### Areas of Improvement

- Error handling: I could improve my error handling mechanisms to provide more informative error messages and handle edge cases more effectively.
- Code organization: While my component architecture was robust, I could improve my code organization by implementing more modular and reusable components.
- Testing: I could improve my testing mechanisms to ensure that my application is thoroughly tested and debugged.

## Overall Learning Experience

- Throughout this project, I had the opportunity to develop a wide range of skills and knowledge that will be beneficial for my future endeavors. One of the most significant takeaways from this project was the importance of understanding the underlying concepts and principles of a framework, rather than just its syntax. In addition to the technical skills I acquired, I also improved my ability to work independently and think critically and creatively. I had to rely on my own resources to overcome challenges and solve problems, and I developed a sense of self-sufficiency and confidence in my abilities.

In conclusion, this project was a valuable learning experience that helped me develop a wide range of skills and knowledge. I gained a deep understanding of Svelte.js and its ecosystem, and I improved my ability to work independently and think critically and creatively. I am proud of the work I did on this project, and I am excited to apply the skills and knowledge I gained to new and challenging initiatives.
