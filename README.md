[JSF02] Project: Svelte Challenge

# Project Overview
- For the project 'JSF02', I was tasked with using the starter code from the CodeSpace-Academy repo in order to refactor into an Svelte.js based project. The repo included an e-commerce store which uses an API to fetch all the data that is displayed in the store, the store was a React based project that included all the accompanying components to build out the e-commerce store. I had to use my new-found knowledge to accomplish this brief and find a way to complete the brief.

# Project Brief 
1. Study and understand the Svelte e-commerce store rubric provided in your student sheet.

2. Have a look at the model e-commerce store provided in React: https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/jsf-react-ecommerce.

3. Study the Fake Store API and see what endpoints you will need to fetch different pieces of data from.

4. Code your solution in Svelte and document your code with JSDoc.

5. Commit changes to your Github repository (remember the naming convention: Module_3_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSF02)

6. Add a README.md file with the project description, how to set it up, technologies used and other information specified in the rubric

7. Test your application for any bugs and improvements.

8. Verify that your changes have been successfully pushed to your remote GitHub repository

9. Submit the GitHub Repository Link to the LMS JSF02 Submission Project Tab.


# Technologies Used 
Svelte.js: An open-source JavaScript framework designed to build user interfaces (UIs) for the web
TailwindCSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling and layout.
Vite: A modern development server and build tool for efficient development and deployment.
Fake Store API: A RESTful API for fetching e-commerce data.


# How to run the project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the project in development mode.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to the localhost link to access the e-commerce store.

# Reflections
## Areas of Mastery 
- None, as this was my first time using the Svelte.js framework. However, I gained valuable experience and knowledge in using Svelte.js to build a complex application.

## Challenges faced
- Learning the Svelte.js framework and its ecosystem.
- Adapting the existing React code to work with Svelte.js.
- Handling state management and props in Svelte.js.
- Debugging and troubleshooting issues with the Fake Store API.

## Areas of Improvement
- Improving my understanding of Svelte.js and its best practices.
- Enhancing the user experience with more features and functionality.
- Writing more efficient and modular code.

# Overall Learning Experience
- Working on this project was difficult, but it was also incredibly satisfying. I had to learn Svelte.js, a new JavaScript framework, and use it to restructure an already-existing web business. I was first put off by the idea of learning a new framework, but as I worked on the project, I grew to love Svelte.js' simplicity and elegance. Adapting pre-existing React code to work with Svelte.js and diagnosing and troubleshooting issues with the Fake Store API were just a few of the hurdles I faced throughout the project. Nonetheless, I learned a lot from each work and gained skills that I may use for other projects. Not only was it crucial to learn grammar for this undertaking, but it was also crucial to comprehend the underlying ideas of the framework. Working with Svelte.js made me realize how powerful its reactive system was and how straightforward its component architecture was. Together with the technical abilities I picked up, I also improved my capacity to work independently and solve problems. I had to use critical and creative thinking throughout the assignment, and I frequently had to rely on my own resources to get over challenges and solve difficulties. All things considered, I'm happy with the work I did on this project and I can't wait to keep developing. I am excited to utilize the abilities and information I have acquired from this project to new and hard initiatives since I think they will be helpful in my future undertakings.
